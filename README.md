 ### Abstract
 Single-image super-resolution (or zoom) is a crucial
problem in image restoration. The goal is to recover the
high frequency information that has been lost through im-
age downsampling and compression. Deep learning meth-
ods are now producing very impressive solutions to this
problem. Numerous super-resolution methods have been
proposed in the computer vision community. Much of the
early work on super-resolution is regression based and
trained with an MSE loss. As such, they effectively esti-
mate the posterior mean, yielding blurry images when the
posterior is multi-modal.
In this project, we will investigate a family of models
called ”denoising diffusion probabilistic models” (DDPM)
which are nowadays of great interest for image generation.
The goal of this project is to get familiar with this type of
method and to understand how they are applied to super-
resolution in this paper (SR3).
